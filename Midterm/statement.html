    <h1>Statement</h1>
    <p>I chose this particular place because I have a personal affinity towards the region in a game, the way you get to interact with NPCs in the game is very friendly and vibrant in the game, so I wanted to try to recreate that in this webpage. I wanted very bright visuals and colors to give the audience a feeling of friendliness and familiarity. I also choose blue specifically as the background because for one, it is a driving color scheme in the region but also because of its soothing nature in color psychology.
	I wanted the button styles to be simple yet modern-like, it factors into the fact that in the world of Tevyat, Fontaine is a very modernized nation, more technologically advanced than most of the rest of the world, from their color choices, architecture, and culture. I wanted to incorporate that into the webpage, mixing in their ever so present blues with blacks and greys. It felt good to include in-game images as well because the region is very vibrant and colorful to allow the audience to get a very good idea what the area is like.</p>
