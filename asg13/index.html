    <h1>The Ideal Job</h1>
    <p>
     I have always had an interest in photography. This does cover a very wide range of photography as a whole but I enjoy taking pictures of people and animals. I feel that jobs that let me explore my abilities in this manner would be the most beneficial for me. Especially the jobs where creative freedom is quite large. I can imagine myself in freelance photography, or those that are more centered around people, rather than pictures of things like products or real estate. The ideal job would be one where I am free to express my outlook on photography while still having enough framework that it can actually pay me something.
