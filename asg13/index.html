    <h1>The Ideal Job</h1>
    <p>
     I have always had an interest in photography/videography. This does cover a very wide range of photography/videography as a whole but I enjoy taking pictures of people and animals. I also like recording videos of moments from people to landscapes to everyday objects. I feel that jobs that let me explore my abilities in this manner would be the most beneficial for me. Especially the jobs where creative freedom is quite large. I can imagine myself in freelance photography, but I can see myself promoting companies like products or real estate. The ideal job would be one where I am free to express my outlook on photography or allowing me to promote a group of people/business while still having enough framework that it can actually pay me something.

        This job expresses that individuals can pursue their creative outlooks on storytelling and event capturing. A perfect match to my desire to always record moments between people and events. Their company describes their purpose to capture genuine, candid moments, not necessarily staged or forced. Major events in people's lives to be recorded and captured. This draws me in with how emotional and impactful this is in a social sense but in a creative sense. It allows me to express my way of telling a persons story through photography and videography.
